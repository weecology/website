## What is HiperGator?

A University of Florida super-computing cluster. 

## Why should I use it?

HiperGator gives the user access to very large processing/memory/storage. This is useful for projects which can't be run on your local laptop.

## How do I access it?

0. [Request an account](http://www.rc.ufl.edu/help/account-request/)

1. Connect with `ssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@hpg2.rc.ufl.edu` from the Unix terminal or a Windows SSH client ([more info here](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Getting_Started)). Enter your password when prompted.

Need help with command line? A good tutorial is available at [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## How do I run a job?

For large analysis, you should submit a *batch script* that tells Hipergator how to run your code. Let's look at an example and walk through it. 

```
#!/bin/bash

# Job name and who to send updates to
#SBATCH --job-name=<JOBNAME>
#SBATCH --mail-user=<EMAIL>
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL,END
#SBATCH --account=ewhite
#SBATCH --partition=hpg2-compute
#SBATCH --qos=ewhite-b   # Remove the `-b` if the script will take more than 4 days; see "bursting" below

# Where to put the outputs: %j expands into the job number (a unique identifier for this job)
#SBATCH --output my_job%j.out
#SBATCH --error my_job%j.err

# Number of nodes to use
#SBATCH --nodes=1

# Number of tasks (usually translate to processor cores) to use: important! this means the number of mpi ranks used, useless if you are not using Rmpi)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1 

#number of cores to parallelize with:
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=15
#SBATCH --mem=16000
# Memory per cpu core. Default is megabytes, but units can be specified with M 
# or G for megabytes or Gigabytes.
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G

# Job run time in [DAYS]
# HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS
# [DAYS] are optional, use when it is convenient
#SBATCH --time=72:00:00

# Save some useful information to the "output" file
date;hostname;pwd

# Load R and run a script named my_R_script.R
Rscript my_R_script.R
```

If you are successful, you'll get a small message stating your job ID. Once your batch job is running, you can freely log out (or even turn off your local machine) and wait for an email telling you that it finished.  You can log back in to see the results later.

## Interactive work

If you are running into errors, need to install a package in your local directory, or want to download some files, you should use a development server. This is good practice and nice to other people who are logged into the main head node. 

```
#load module made by hipergator admin
ml ufrc
#request a server for 3 hours with 2GB of memory
srundev --time 3:00:00 --mem 2GB
```

## How do I know if its running?

Use `squeue -u <username>`

```
squeue -u b.weinstein
[b.weinstein@login3 ~]$ squeue -u b.weinstein
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          25666905       gpu DeepFore b.weinst  R   22:29:49      1 c36a-s7
          25672257       gpu DeepFore b.weinst  R   21:07:19      1 c37a-s36
```

The column labeled "S" is your job status. You want this to be `R` for "running", but it can spend a while as `Q` (in the queue) before starting, especially if you request many cores. Sometimes (but not always) the output will explain why you're still in the queue (e.g. QOSMEMLIMIT if you're using too much memory).

## How do I get my data on to HiperGator?

* Often, the easiest way to transfer files to the server is using `git clone`.

* If your files aren't in a git repository, you can use FTP or `scp`.  FTP has graphical user interfaces that allow you to drag and drop files to the server.

* If you use `scp`, the syntax for copying one file from your user folder on the server to your local folder is `scp MY_USER_NAME@gator.hpc.ufl.edu:/home/MY_USER_NAME/PATH_TO_MY_FILE MY_LOCAL_FILENAME`. Note the space between the remote path and your local filename. If you want to  send a file in the other direction, switch the order of the local file and the remote location.  You can copy whole folders with the `-r` flag.

If you prefer a Dropbox-like interface, you can also hook GatorBox up to HiperGator using [these instructions](https://wiki.rc.ufl.edu/doc/GatorBox:_Adding_external_storage).

[More information about storage](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/about/policies/storage/)

## Storage

There are a few locations to store files on the hipergator

`/ufrc`  
This is the primary space for storing large files, any large amounts of data generated by your programs should be pointed to this location. 

`/orange`  
This is another space to store large files. The total allocation here is much bigger than `/ufrc`, but this storage space is slower than `/ufrc`. If you have 100GB's of data that you want to save, but are not currently using, `/orange` is where they should go.

`/home`  
Your home directory has 20GB storage space for your scripts, logs, etc. You should not be storing large amounts of data here.

`$TMPDIR`  
`/ufrc` may be a bad place to store temporary cache files, especially if your program is generating 100's of small (<1mb) files. An alternative is to use a temporary directory setup by SLURM every time you run a job. This can be referenced with the environment variable `$TMPDIR` or `SLURM_TMPDIR`. Read more about this here: [Temporary Directories
](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Temporary_Directories).

Note that for `/ufrc` and `/orange` there is a designated folder for you under `/ufrc/ewhite/<your_username>/` and `/orange/ewhite/<your_username>/`.

Our current allocations as of July 2019

| Storage Type | Location                | Quota |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------|
| orange       | `/orange`               | 20TB  |
| blue         | `/ufrc`                 | 4TB   |
| home         | `/home/<your_username>` | 20GB  |

## Best Practices

Below are a collection of best practices by past Weecology Users. These are not the only way to do things, just some useful tools that worked for us.

## R

### Installing packages

HiPerGator has a lot of packages installed already, but you might need to install your own, or you might want an updated version of an existing package.

You can tell R to prefer your personal library of R packages over the ones maintained for Hipergator by adding `.libPaths(c("/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/R_libs", .libPaths()))` to your `.Rprofile`.  If you don't have one yet, you can create a new file with that name and put it in your home directory (e.g. in `/home/harris.d/.Rprofile`).

The end result will look like this.

```
[b.weinstein@dev1 ~]$ cat ~/.Rprofile
.libPaths(c("/home/b.weinstein/R_libs", .libPaths()))

print(".Rprofile loaded")
```

You will need to create the `R_libs` directory using `mkdir R_libs`.

When you load R, you should see 

```
[b.weinstein@dev1 ~]$ ml R
[b.weinstein@dev1 ~]$ R

R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- "Feather Spray"
Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

[1] ".Rprofile loaded"
>
```

Once this is set up, you can install or update packages the usual way (e.g. with `install.packages` or `devtools::install_github`).

### Re-writing your code to take advantage of multiple cores. 
By default R runs on a single processor. Most computers today have 4-8 processors. If you spread the work out to multiple processors you can decrease the amount of time it takes to run by significantly. For example: a script that takes 1 hour to run can potentially take 0.5 hours with 2 processors, or 15 minutes with 4 processors. To make your scripts run across multiple processors, you'll have to make some slight adjustments to your code.

If your code uses `lapply` to run your main function to many items (e.g. fitting a model to each species), you can swap it for `mclapply` from the `parallel` package without making any substantial changes. For more details and advanced uses, here are 2 short tutorials that go over this:

* [A brief foray into parallel processing with R](https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/a-brief-foray-into-parallel-processing-with-r/)

* [Software Carpentry Parallel Processing in R](http://resbaz.github.io/r-intermediate-gapminder/19-foreach.html)

Some quick notes: 
* If your code already uses functions and for loops, it should be very easy to make it parallel, unless each pass through the loop depends on the outcome from previous passes.
* On your own computer, never set the amount of processors used to the max available. This will take away all the processing power needed to run the operating system, browser, and other programs, and could potentially crash your computer. To test out parallel code on my computer I set the number of processors to use at 2 (out of 8 available).

## Batchtools

Recently, the R package batchtools has made simple parallel job submissions in R much easier. No more bash scripting, just submit a set of jobs by mapping a function to a list of inputs. Here is an example.


```
library(batchtools)

#Batchtools tmp registry
reg = loadRegistry(file.dir = NA, seed = 1)
print(reg)
print("registry created")

print(reg)
# Toy function  that just sleeps
fun = function(n) {
  Sys.sleep(10)
  t<-Sys.time()
  print(paste("worker", n, "time is",t))
  return(t)
}

#batchtools submission
reg$cluster.functions=makeClusterFunctionsSlurm(template = "detection_template.tmpl", array.jobs = TRUE,nodename = "localhost", scheduler.latency = 1, fs.latency = 65)
ids = batchMap(fun,args=list(n=seq(1:10)), reg = reg)

testJob(id=ids[1,],reg=reg)

# Set resources: enable memory measurement
res = list(walltime = "2:00:00", memory = "4GB")

# Submit jobs using the currently configured cluster functions
submitJobs(ids, resources = res, reg = reg)
waitForJobs(ids, reg = reg)
getStatus(reg = reg)
print(getJobTable())
```

with a SLURM template in the same directory.

detection_template.tmpl
```
#!/bin/bash

## ntasks [integer(1)]:       Number of required tasks,
##                            Set larger than 1 if you want to further parallelize
##                            with MPI within your job.
## ncpus [integer(1)]:        Number of required cpus per task,
##                            Set larger than 1 if you want to further parallelize
##                            with multicore/parallel within each task.
## walltime [integer(1)]:     Walltime for this job, in seconds.
##                            Must be at least 60 seconds for Slurm to work properly.
## memory   [integer(1)]:     Memory in megabytes for each cpu.

```


## Python

### Installing Python Packages

* ssh onto HiperGator
* Download the conda installer: `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
* Run the installer: `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
* Answer 'Yes' at the end of the install to have conda added to your `.bashrc`
* Install packages using `conda install package_name`
* Run `conda activate` as the first step in your slurm script 

### Dask Parallelization

Dask can be submitted through dask-jobqueue. 

```
#################
    # Setup dask cluster
    #################
    
    from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster
    from dask.distributed import Client, wait
    
    num_workers = 10
    
    #job args
    extra_args=[
        "--error=/home/b.weinstein/logs/dask-worker-%j.err",
        "--account=ewhite",
        "--output=/home/b.weinstein/logs/dask-worker-%j.out"
    ]
    
    cluster = SLURMCluster(
        processes=1,
        queue='hpg2-compute',
        cores=1, 
        memory='13GB', 
        walltime='24:00:00',
        job_extra=extra_args,
        local_directory="/home/b.weinstein/logs/", death_timeout=300)
    
    print(cluster.job_script())
    cluster.adapt(minimum=num_workers, maximum=num_workers)
    
    dask_client = Client(cluster)
        
    #Start dask
    dask_client.run_on_scheduler(start_tunnel)  
    
    futures = dask_client.map(<function you want to parallelize>,  <list of objects to run>, <additional args here>)
    wait(futures)
```

### Connecting through jupyter notebooks.

Its useful to be able to interact with hipergator, without having to rely solely on the terminal. Especially when dealing with large datasets, instead of prototyping locally, then pushing to the cloud, we can connect directly using a jupyter notebook.

* Log on to hipergator and request an interactive session.

```
srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=2gb -t 90 --pty bash -i
```

Now we have 90 minutes work directly on this development node.

* Create a juypter notebook

Load the python module

```
module load python
```

Start the notebook and get your ssh tunnel

```
import socket
import subprocess
host = socket.gethostname()
proc = subprocess.Popen(['jupyter', 'lab', '--ip', host, '--no-browser'])

print("ssh -N -L 8888:%s:8888 -l b.weinstein hpg2.rc.ufl.edu" % (host))
```

If all went well it should look something like:

```
[b.weinstein@c27b-s2 dask-jobqueue]$ python

```

see that line ssh..., that is what we need to enter in our local laptop. It will ask for your login password

```
MacBook-Pro:~ ben$ ssh -N -L 8888:c27b-s2.ufhpc:8888 -l b.weinstein hpg2.rc.ufl.edu
b.weinstein@hpg2.rc.ufl.edu's password: 
```

Don't worry if it looks like it hangs, the tunnel is open! Go check it out.

Opening your browner, go to localhost:8888

and viola, we are navigating hipergator from the confines of our own laptop.

### Tensorflow and conda env

To make use of the GPU machine learning environment, but also have access to your packages, creating a conda env with all your needs except tensorflow and keras and then add them to the python path after loading the tensorflow module.

```
ml git
ml gcc
ml geos
ml tensorflow
export PATH=${PATH}:/home/b.weinstein/miniconda/envs/DeepLidar/bin/
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/b.weinstein/miniconda/envs/DeepLidar/lib/python3.6/site-packages/
echo $PYTHONPATH

/home/b.weinstein/DeepLidar
python train.py --mode train
```

## Support

 [Request Support](https://support.rc.ufl.edu/enter_bug.cgi).

Hipergator staff are here to support you. Our grant money pays their salary. They are friendly and eager to help. When in doubt, just ask.

For more information on (job submission scripts)[https://wiki.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Annotated_SLURM_Script]

### Priority

The supercomputer is a shared resource, and the SLURM scheduler has to decide how to divvy it up. The method they use for deciding when it's your turn to use a machine based on a metric called "FairShare." You can see your FairShare number by typing `sshare -U` in your hipergator terminal.  A FairShare of 0.5 means you've been using exactly your share. Larger numbers mean you can use more, while smaller numbers mean you're using more than your share and will be given lower priority.

Your "usage" number is an exponentially-weighted moving average of the resources you've consumed, with a half-life of two weeks. So if you've "bursted" at 10x for a while, it might take a few weeks before you're given decent priority again.  

A more comprehensive description of FairShare is available [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html#fairshare).

### Bursting

If your jobs will take less than 4 days, you can use "burst" mode, which provides *ten times* as many cores and *ten times* as much memory as the default mode. If you cannot burst, just remove the `-b` from the line above about `qos`. Note than if you are using burst your jobs will automatically be killed after 96 hours if they haven't already finished.

### Current usage  

To see the current usage by our group, as well as overall hipergator usage, use the command  

`slurmInfo -pu`  

A nice website showing the status of all jobs in the group is available [here](https://access.rc.ufl.edu/jobstatus/)

To see the total available resources use: 

`sacctmgr show qos ewhite format="Name%-16,GrpSubmit,MaxWall,GrpTres%-45"`   
for the normal queue, and    
`sacctmgr show qos ewhite-b format="Name%-16,GrpSubmit,MaxWall,GrpTres%-45"`   
for the "burst" queue.   

## Partitions
The HiperGator consists of hundreds of servers. These a split up into several "partitions" for various reasons.

The two primary partitions which you'll use the most are `hpg1-compute`, and `hpg2-compute`.

* `hpg1-compute` - This is the set of older servers that make up the original hipergator cluster. They have 64 cores and 256GB of RAM per node. 
* `hpg2-compute` - This is a newer set of servers brought online in 2017. They have 32 cores and 128GB of RAM per node 

The cores on `hpg2-compute` are roughly twice as fast as the  ones on `hpg1-compute`. So the former partition is usually under a heavier load when you look at the current usage with `slurmInfo -pu`. 

There are a few other partitions available.

* `gpu` - This is the partition to use if you want to use the GPU. You need to have bought GPU specifically, which our lab has.
* `bigmem` - This partitions consists of several servers with up to 1TB of memory. This is useful if you need a *lot* of memory but still want to keep a script on a single server. More details are [here](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Large-Memory_SMP_Servers).
* `hpg2-dev` - These are several servers for development purposes. When you use `srundev` the jobs get sent here.
* `gui` - For jobs where you want to run a GUI (graphical user interface). 

**Selecting a partition** By default you'll run jobs on the `hpg2-compute` partitions. If you want to change it, edit the `--partition` line in your job script, or use the `-p` command in `srun`. 

## Check if running on HiPerGator

Sometimes it's useful to have code execute one way on your local computer and another way on the HPC. For HiPerGator you can do this by checking the environmental variable HOSTNAME and looking to see if it contains `ufhpc`. For example, in R

```
if (grepl("ufhpc", Sys.getenv("HOSTNAME"))){
  hipergator_run()
} else {
  local_run()
}
```
If you are submitting via SLURM, the hostname will not contain "ufhpc" but the nodename will. So use this logic:

```
nodename <- Sys.info()["nodename"]
if(grepl("ufhpc", nodename)) {
  print("I know I am on SLURM!")
}
```

## Using RStudio on the hipergator

See the main Wiki page here on running gui programs. https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/GUI_Programs#Start_a_GUI_Session_on_HiPerGator
