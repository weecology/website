Ethan's studies data-intensive problems in ecology including ecological forecasting and using high resolution remote sensing to understand individual level patterns in ecological systems at large scales. He is actively involved in computational training efforts as a Data Carpentry co-founder, former Executive Committee member of The Carpentries, and lead developer of the semester long Data Carpentry course.
