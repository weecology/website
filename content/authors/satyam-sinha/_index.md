Satyam is an Undergraduated Student in Computer Science at Cluster Innovation Centre, Delhi. He has been selected in Google Summer of Code 2023 to work on the project [Tree health and mortality from NEON data](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HooCVkAe). The goal of this project is build a new function that populates the NEON field and remote sensing data for deepforest which will help us build a baseline classification for tree health status.
