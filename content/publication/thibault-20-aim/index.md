abstract: 'ABSTRACT Aim  Body size often plays a significant role in community assembly
  through its impacts on the life history and ecological attributes of species. Insight
  into the importance of size in structuring communities can be gained by examining
  the distribution of sizes of individuals [i.e. the individual size distribution
  (ISD) or size spectrum] in a community. ISDs have been studied extensively in aquatic
  and tree communities, but have received little attention in terrestrial animal communities.
  Here, we conduct the first macroecological analysis of ISDs in terrestrial animal
  communities to determine whether they show broad-scale consistency in shape. Location 
  North America, north of Mexico. Methods  Using likelihood-based methods and Gaussian
  mixture modelling, coupled with data from the Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas
  Bird Count, we determine whether the ISDs for thousands of breeding and wintering
  North American bird communities are: (1) monotonically decreasing, (2) unimodal
  or (3) multimodal. Results  We find that avian ISDs are consistently multimodal,
  with most characterized by more than five modes in both breeding and wintering communities
  from local to continental scales. In addition, the positions of these modes along
  the size axis are remarkably consistent. Main conclusions  The striking consistency
  in the ISD within bird communities, as with tree and aquatic communities, indicates
  that the ISD is an important and informative characterization of resource utilization
  within an ecological assemblage. The differences in shape of the ISD among these
  groups also suggest that differences in body size-related constraints affect interactions
  within a group and with the environment. Our results confirm that avian assemblages
  do exhibit structure along the body size axis, and therefore it will be fruitful
  to explore this pattern in greater detail.'
