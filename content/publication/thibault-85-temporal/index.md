abstract: The rank-abundance distribution (RAD) represents the manner in which species
  divide resources. Community-specific division rules that determine resource allocation
  among species, and thereby the shape of the RAD, have been hypothesized to account
  for observed stability of local species richness over time. While the shape of the
  RAD has been well studied, the temporal dynamics of this distribution have received
  much less attention. Here we assess changes in the shape of the RAD through time
  in a desert rodent community in Arizona (USA). Because energy use may be more appropriate
  for studying resource division than abundance, we also evaluate an energetic equivalent
  of the RAD. Significant, directional trends in the shapes of both distributions
  are present in this community. These changes are driven by trends in the relative
  abundances (or energy use) of Ranks 2, 3, and 4, and are significantly correlated
  with variation in total energy use by the community and with compositional change.
  Our results suggest that (1) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are not
  static and can change directionally through time, (2) species richness and rank
  distributions are not necessarily as intimately connected as early studies assumed,
  and (3) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are influenced by both the
  amount of energy available to the community and species-specific interactions.
